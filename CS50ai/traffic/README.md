What did you try? What worked well? What didnâ€™t work well? What did you notice?
different numbers of convolutional and pooling layers
different numbers and sizes of filters for convolutional layers
different pool sizes for pooling layers
different numbers and sizes of hidden layers
dropout

having added one additional layer with more units, it was observed that the accuracy of the testing and algorithm was higher.
furthermore, having the same number of layers but with different units, those with more units were found to have a higher accuracy compared to those without.
