when get to above 4 forms to submit and creating states to save variables, better to save a state in an object with one setter function to update a specific piece of state 

 the value component in for each input box---the value of the input box is not controlled by the input but by React
 every change i makes runs the handleChange function which updates the correct piece of state which rerenders the form and sets the value component to be whatever state is 
 therefore, state is telling the input box what should be displayed instead of input box telling state what it should be
