React Carpark Locator
This project is a React application designed to display a map with markers indicating various carpark locations. It utilizes the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) API to fetch carpark information and leverages Google Maps API for map rendering. The application includes a proxy server setup for handling token authentication with the URA API and converts SVY21 coordinates to latitude and longitude for accurate positioning on the map.
